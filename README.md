DiscreteLogarithmCalculator - calculates the discrete logarith, or the solution for k in b^k = g, where b is the base of the logarithm and g is the value whose logarithm is being taken. This was written in Intel x86 assembly. It requires the Irvine libraries for printing values to the screen. It only works for smaller numbers. This program uses a few custom functions that I wrote myself, including a square root calculator.
